*** you need to use contiainers ***
container path : /storage/osg-otte1/shared/TrinityDemonstrator/DataAnalysis/containers
container : rootandexact.sif - has root and exact compiled

To run with HTCondor as a batch of jobs per night for muliple nights using a .csv that contains all target nights
Use ./submit_night.sh YYYYMMDD for a single batched night or 
./submit_night.sh file.csv to provide a list of nights to run
Sample ./submit_night.sh condor_list/Rank8.csv


You will need to move the data after it is complete
you can do this with 
./move_merged_files.sh . Output
./move_merged_files.sh <location from> <locations to>


these are already built into the scripts 
to run a single night not as a job
./run_script.sh - calls and mounts the container to allow the fill function to work. 
 - changed the way ./FileMerge runs - so now arguments are YYYYMMDD mount_filepath(within TrinityDemonstrator) singlefile?
  
 ./runscript.sh YYYYMMDD n so just to run a whole day
 ./runscript.sh YYYYMMDD filename will run just one file 



Running with HTCondor
To run a whole night use
./submit.sh YYYYMMDD - this will run every file in a night as its own job (this is needed as to not bog down file transfers)
    - watcher.py: This uses a watcher script to ensure file will be transfered after completation to the correct desitnation as HTCondor can not handle this
    - condense_SM.submit: this handle the HTCondor job creatation and enviromnet and well as input and output files
    - run_condor.sh: This is the exactable run by the HTCondor job that will create the file structure and all of the movemenent to make the script run in the enviroment



To run a single file use
./condense_SM.submit YYYYMMDD Filename
** You will need to move the root file upon completation unless you start the watcher script **


to recompile 
if you are just remaking in the /scripts/MergedData/ there is a file that will recompile
./complile_script.sh - loads the contianer and makes the script 

to start the watcher script independently you will need to open the python container 
apptainer exec python3_10.py 


All files wiil  end up in the Merged Directory folder and need to be sorted 
This sorting into Output/YYYYMMDD can be done with 
./move_sorted_files . Output

# how to run file merge script
sbatch submit.sbatch YYYYMMDD 
# or 

will take all the ancillary data from Statemessages, Weather, Celestial positions and add them to the data .root files 
./FileMerge 20250124 
# or AllFileMerge.py

will add the absolute gain informaiton to the data .root files
./AllCalibData 20250124
