---------------- BUZZARD -------------------

*** you need to use contiainers ***
container path : /storage/osg-otte1/shared/TrinityDemonstrator/DataAnalysis/containers
container : rootandexact.sif - has root and exact compiled

To run a batch of jobs per night for muliple nights using a .csv that contains all target nights
Use ./submit_night.sh YYYYMMDD for a single batched night or 
./submit_night.sh file.csv to provide a list of nights to run
Sample ./submit_night.sh condor_list/Rank8.csv

to run a single night not as a job
./run_script.sh - calls and mounts the container to allow the fill function to work. 
 - changed the way ./FileMerge runs - so now arguments are YYYYMMDD mount_filepath(within TrinityDemonstrator) singlefile?
  
 ./runscript.sh YYYYMMDD n so just to run a whole day
 ./runscript.sh YYYYMMDD filename will run just one file 

Running with HTCondor
To run a whole night use
./submit.sh YYYYMMDD - this will run every file in a night as its own job (this is needed as to not bog down file transfers)
    - watcher.py: This uses a watcher script to ensure file will be transfered after completation to the correct desitnation as HTCondor can not handle this
    - condense_SM.submit: this handle the HTCondor job creatation and enviromnet and well as input and output files
    - run_condor.sh: This is the exactable run by the HTCondor job that will create the file structure and all of the movemenent to make the script run in the enviroment

To run a single file use
./condense_SM.submit YYYYMMDD Filename
** You will need to move the root file upon completation unless you start the watcher script **

**** my changes ****
adding in another argument for the user for output directory
condense_SM.submit and run_condor.sh
will output files in MergedData/Output/theUser_MergedFiles/

changing file paths in cpp scripts where it outputs to /MergedData/Output/ ?
runFile3.cpp, AddSiPmInfoToEvents.cpp
