Event cleaning script with local and job sumbission options
For more information on how the eventcleaning works see the eventcleaning pdf


Containers /DataAnalysis/containers

------------------------------ Buzzard (contianers) -----------------------------------------------------------
To run with the container localy use
./run_script.sh YYYYMMDD
    This will use a container and mount the system directories to locate and create the eventcleaning files
    Uses: ClusterCleaning/EventCleaning
    Container: rootandexact

To run with HTCondor as a batch of jobs per night for muliple nights using a .csv that contains all target nights
Use ./submit_night.sh YYYYMMDD for a single batched night or 
./submit_night.sh file.csv to provide a list of nights to run
Sample ./submit_nights.sh condor_list/Rank8.csv


Reducing the output to a single file per night
use the ./run_reduce_script.sh path/to/directory 
sample ./run_reduce_script.sh Outputs/sstepanoff3_DataFiles
    This will take all the event cleanings data with timestamps *HH:DD.root and combine them into a single file for the nigth
    *PLEASE NOTE THIS WILL OVERRIDE ITSELF so be careful*
    This code runs off of reducedata.sh

DEPECEATED
To run with HTcondor as a job this works for one night and sends each file as its own job
Use ./sumbit.sh filename.csv - csv contains a list of YYYYMMDD to submit
./submit.sh YYYYMMDD - just get one date

This will run the individual job
submit.sh - the script that reads in all the merged file for that date and processes the event cleaning one by one file 
condor_submit "Date=YYYYMMDD" "Filename=Mergedfile" condense_SM.submit
    This will use a HTCondor job to use the container and run the script on the HTC. 
    Sumbit Script: condense_SM.submit
    Uses: run_condor.sh
    Container: rootandexact.sif 
run_condor.sh - this creates the container enviroment for running the event cleaning and all the files organized into the correct file structure. 

*** my changes ***
changing file paths where it draws from MergedData/Output or flasher_calibration/Output so it draws from the right directory for the user
submit_night.sh, run_condor.sh, EventCleaning.cpp
