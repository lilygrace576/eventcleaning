This is the flatfield calibration from the flasher

i thought nepomuk called this a gain calibration at some point so i may need to chagne it back to flatfielding at some point 


This script will only create 
the calibration factors using the `CalibrationFactor.cpp` and `CalibrationFactor.h` files.

## Overview

These files implement the calculation of calibration factors for the flasher system. The calibration factors are used to correct for variations in detector response and ensure accurate measurements.

## Files

- **CalibrationFactor.cpp**: Contains the implementation of the calibration factor calculation logic.
- **CalibrationFactor.h**: makes the code cleaner and stores includes and fucntions

## Usage
---- Buzard ----
Use ./compile_script to make as it will open the contianer and make (can do ./compile_script clean)
Use ./run_script.sh YYYYMMDD to run the script. It will open the contianer and then run the script and place the outputs
Use ./run_condor.sh - part of the submit for HTCOndors jobs (no done yet)

*** my changes ***

creating submit_night.sh, condense_SM.submit, and run_condor.sh for flasher calibration so we can run the dates as jobs 
can run either single night or multiple nights from a csv

no longer drawing from or creating user specific folder within outputs

adding in user env for .log file paths and file names in condense_SM.submit
